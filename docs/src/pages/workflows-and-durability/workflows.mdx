# Workflows

There are two ways of modeling workflows:

1. **Structured workflows**: the Temporal style, where a workflow is executed by
   the system, similarly to if we just called a function and let that function
   process. It is possible to have interruption points within the workflow for
   human or external input, but mostly you can think of this like weâ€™re running
   a sequence of code. Name inspired by
   [Structured programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming).
2. **Request/Reply workflows**: a client/server request/response model. this is
   well suited for chatbots where the workflow only advances to the next step
   after a user interaction. The Form Agent is an example of this.
