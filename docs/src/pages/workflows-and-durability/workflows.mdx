# Workflows

There are two ways of modeling workflows:

1. **Structured workflows**: let you decorate your normal Python functions and
   classes so what looks like a normal program gets the abilities of:
   durability, AI memory, human-in-the-loop, and workflow-specific RAG.
2. **Request/Reply workflows**: a client/server request/response model. This is
   well suited for chatbots where the workflow only advances to the next step
   after a user interaction. The Form Agent is an example of this.

## Structured workflows

Structured workflows let you decorate functions and classes to define workflows
that are [durable][durable], give agents memory about the steps the tasks and
steps in a workflow, load docs for RAG or search, and add human-in-the-loop.

It is also possible to have interruption points within the workflow for human or
external input.

If you are familiar with [Temporal](https://temporal.io/), structured workflows
look similarly, but each workflow is given extra LLM-specific features.  The
name is inspired by [structured programming][structured-programming].

See more docs and an example in the
[structured workflows section](/workflows-and-durability/structured-workflows).
