# Workflows

There are two ways of modeling workflows:

1. **Structured workflows**: the Temporal style, where a workflow is executed by
   the system, similarly to if we just called a function and let that function
   process. It is possible to have interruption points within the workflow for
   human or external input, but mostly you can think of this like weâ€™re running
   a sequence of code. Name inspired by
   [Structured programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming).
2. **Request/Reply workflows**: a client/server request/response model. This is
   well suited for chatbots where the workflow only advances to the next step
   after a user interaction. The Form Agent is an example of this.

## Structured workflows

_docs coming soon_

## Request/Reply workflows

These types of workflows are particularly well suited for building powerful chatbots.
One of the benefits of augmenting a request/reply chat flow with a workflow
is that it allows us to build powerful chatbot state machines that are durable, fault-tolerant, and can handle multiple concurrent conversations.

#### FastAPI Example

This example demonstrates how to build a powerful chatbot experience that generates Invoice forms for its users.
If you want to skip the step-by-step explanation of the code, you can check out the [FastAPI example](https://github.com/gofixpoint/fixpoint/blob/main/src/fixpoint_extras/services/fastapi/local_server.py) in our repo.
It's a little over 100 lines of code!

#### Requirements

Before jumping into the code, let's discuss what we want our bot to do:

1. The bot should be able to have a conversation with a user
2. Classify the user's intent
3. Start filling out a form based on that intent.
4. Be extendible such that we can add new flows in the future

#### Initial Setup

Our chatbot will be interacting with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, so we'll need to pass in our OpenAI API key.

```python
import os

_openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not _openai_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set or is empty")
```

#### Workflow

Now we can start architecting our chatbot! At the heart of the chat bot is a `Workflow`.
A workflow is responsible for orchestrating the entire flow of conversation and it is the highest level of abstraction that we can have.
For now we'll just define a simple workflow:

```python {1,3-5,11}
import os

from fixpoint_extras.workflows.imperative import (
    Workflow,
)

_openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not _openai_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set or is empty")

_wf = Workflow(id="test_workflow")
```

#### Workflow Run

One of the core components of a Workflow is a `WorkflowRun`. You can think of a `WorkflowRun` as a single instance of a workflow.
A key feature of a `WorkflowRun` is that state and memory are scoped to the run. This means that you can have multiple WorkflowRuns for the same Workflow and they will not share state.
In order for our chatbot to handle multiple conversations, we'll need to create a separate `WorkflowRun` for each conversation. One way to do this is to register a FastAPI route
that will create a new `WorkflowRun`.

```python {3,7,16-21}
import os

from fastapi import FastAPI

from fixpoint_extras.workflows.imperative import (
    Workflow,
    WorkflowRun,
)

_openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not _openai_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set or is empty")

_wf = Workflow(id="test_workflow")

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/workflow_runs")
def create_workflow_run() -> WorkflowRun:
    """Create a new workflow run."""
    return _wf.run()
```

As you can see creating a run is just as easy as calling `run()` on a workflow object.
This method can be called multiple times and each call will return a new `WorkflowRun`.
Each `WorkflowRun` has a unique ID and can be used to store information about the conversation.
The following FastAPI decorator, `@app.post("/workflow_runs")`, indicates that this method is called when an `HTTP POST` request is made to the `/workflow_runs` endpoint.

Now, that we have a `WorkflowRun`, let's make our chatbot interactive.
The first thing we'll need to do is to create an endpoint for the user to interact with our chatbot.
This will be an `HTTP POST` request that will send a message to the chatbot and get a response.

```python {23-26}
import os

from fastapi import FastAPI

from fixpoint_extras.workflows.imperative import (
    Workflow,
    WorkflowRun,
)

_openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not _openai_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set or is empty")

_wf = Workflow(id="test_workflow")

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/workflow_runs")
def create_workflow_run() -> WorkflowRun:
    """Create a new workflow run."""
    return _wf.run()

@app.post("/workflow_runs/{workflow_run_id}/chats")
def create_chat(workflow_run_id: str, user_message: str) -> str:
    """Create a chat for a workflow run."""
    pass
```

This endpoint takes a `workflow_run_id` which we have created by calling `create_workflow_run()` and a `user_message` which is the message the user sent to the chatbot.
The chatbot will then use this information to generate a response.

#### Workflow Context

The next thing we need to do is to load a `WorkflowRun` and then create a `WorkflowContext`.
The `WorkflowContext` is a wrapper around a `WorkflowRun` that provides a way to interact with the `WorkflowRun` along with other
constructs provided by Fixpoint such as a logger, cache and agents.
You could in theory write flows without using the `WorkflowContext`, but it provides a lot of convenience.
In our example we'll create a function that does this for us:

```python {3,4,8,15-18,35-44}
import os

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fixpoint_extras.services.formagent.setup import get_workflow_agent
from fixpoint_extras.workflows.imperative import (
    Workflow,
    WorkflowRun,
    WorkflowContext
)

_openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not _openai_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set or is empty")

_wfagent = get_workflow_agent(
    openai_key=_openai_key,
    model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)

_wf = Workflow(id="test_workflow")

app = FastAPI()


@app.post("/workflow_runs")
def create_workflow_run() -> WorkflowRun:
    """Create a new workflow run."""
    return _wf.run()

@app.post("/workflow_runs/{workflow_run_id}/chats")
def create_chat(workflow_run_id: str, user_message: str) -> str:
    """Create a chat for a workflow run."""
    pass

def get_workflow_context(workflow_run_id: str) -> WorkflowContext:
    """Get the workflow context for a workflow run."""
    # Load workflow run using provided identifier
    wfrun = _wf.load_run(workflow_run_id)
    if wfrun is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Workflow run not found")

    # Instantiate workflow context
    return WorkflowContext.from_workflow(wfrun, [_wfagent])
```

You may have noticed that we also created an Agent.
This is a key part of our chatbot, as the configuration of the agent dictates how we communicate with our inference provider.
In this example we're using a convenience method `get_workflow_agent` which returns a `fixpoint.agents.OpenAIAgent`.
This agent is configured to use the passed in OpenAI key and gpt-3.5-turbo model version.

#### Workflow Run > Reading Node State

Node state is the core of our chatbot. It is the state of a `WorkflowRun` at a given point in time.
It is a key part of our chatbot, as the state of a `WorkflowRun` dictates how we handle the user's message.
State is broken down into two parts: "task" and "step".
The "task" is the high level action that the chatbot is trying to complete.
The "step" is the specific action within the task that the chatbot is trying to complete.

For instance let's say we want to accomplish the goal of throwing an awesome party. Here are some tasks and underlying steps that we could have:

- Task 1: Get party supplies
  - Step 1: Go to party store
  - Step 2: Pick up supplies
  - Step 3: Go home
- Task 2: Plan party
  - Step 1: Create a plan
  - Step 2: Plan the party
  - Step 3: Create a schedule
  - Step 4: Send invites
- Task 3: Throw party
  - Step 1: Greet guests
  - Step 2: Throw the party
  - Step 3: Celebrate
  - Step 4: Do dishes

Tasks and steps are defined in the [`NodeState`](https://github.com/gofixpoint/fixpoint/blob/main/src/fixpoint_extras/workflows/imperative/workflow.py) class.
It is up to the developer's discretion to determine what constitutes a task or a step. In our example we'll work only with tasks, but you can also work with steps.

Let's expand our `create_chat` function a bit:

```python {10-12,36-48}
import os

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fixpoint_extras.services.formagent.setup import get_workflow_agent
from fixpoint_extras.workflows.imperative import (
    Workflow,
    WorkflowRun,
    WorkflowContext
)
from fixpoint_extras.services.formagent.tasks import (
    FormType
)

_openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not _openai_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set or is empty")

_wfagent = get_workflow_agent(
    openai_key=_openai_key,
    model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)

_wf = Workflow(id="test_workflow")

app = FastAPI()


@app.post("/workflow_runs")
def create_workflow_run() -> WorkflowRun:
    """Create a new workflow run."""
    return _wf.run()

@app.post("/workflow_runs/{workflow_run_id}/chats")
def create_chat(workflow_run_id: str, user_message: str) -> str:
    """Create a chat for a workflow run."""
    wfctx = get_workflow_context(workflow_run_id)
    task = wfctx.workflow_run.node_state.task
    if task == "__main__":
        # Classify the task on an initial message
        pass
    elif task == FormType.INVOICE.value:
        # Handle invoice
        pass
    elif task == FormType.EVENT_REGISTRATION.value:
        # Handle event registration
        pass
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Unsupported task")

def get_workflow_context(workflow_run_id: str) -> WorkflowContext:
    """Get the workflow context for a workflow run."""
    # Load workflow run using provided identifier
    wfrun = _wf.load_run(workflow_run_id)
    if wfrun is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Workflow run not found")

    # Instantiate workflow context
    return WorkflowContext.from_workflow(wfrun, [_wfagent])
```

The first thing you may notice is that we instantiate a `WorkflowContext`, which we'll need to access the workflow run and the underlying state.
We then get the task from the workflow run via `wfctx.workflow_run.node_state.task` and our logic branches out:

If the task is `__main__`, we'll need to classify the task.
If the task is `FormType.INVOICE.value`, we'll need to handle the invoice.
If the task is `FormType.EVENT_REGISTRATION.value`, we'll need to handle the event registration.
(FormType is just an enum that we have defined in our example to represent the two types of forms we want to handle)

One important thing to point out is that the `__main__` task denotes the initial, or default task that is created.
By default, when a run gets created it creates a `NodeState` with the `task` and `step` set to `__main__`.
It is up to the developer to update the `NodeState` to a different task and step (i.e. `FormType.INVOICE.value` or `FormType.EVENT_REGISTRATION.value`) which we will see in the next section.

What we have accomplished so far by expanding our `create_chat` function is that we defined a logical flow for our chatbot to follow.
In the next section we'll see how to handle the user's message and update the `NodeState` to a different task and step.

#### Workflow Run > Updating Node State

The next thing our chatbot needs to do is classify the user's message in order to figure out what the user's intent is and how to proceed.
We'll need to create a function that will do this for us.

```python {11, 50-59}
import os

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fixpoint_extras.services.formagent.setup import get_workflow_agent
from fixpoint_extras.workflows.imperative import (
    Workflow,
    WorkflowRun,
    WorkflowContext
)
from fixpoint_extras.services.formagent.tasks import (
    classify_form_type,
    FormType
)

_openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not _openai_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set or is empty")

_wfagent = get_workflow_agent(
    openai_key=_openai_key,
    model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)

_wf = Workflow(id="test_workflow")

app = FastAPI()


@app.post("/workflow_runs")
def create_workflow_run() -> WorkflowRun:
    """Create a new workflow run."""
    return _wf.run()

@app.post("/workflow_runs/{workflow_run_id}/chats")
def create_chat(workflow_run_id: str, user_message: str) -> str:
    """Create a chat for a workflow run."""
    wfctx = get_workflow_context(workflow_run_id)
    task = wfctx.workflow_run.node_state.task
    if task == "__main__":
        return classify_task(wfctx, user_message)
    elif task == FormType.INVOICE.value:
        # Handle invoice
        pass
    elif task == FormType.EVENT_REGISTRATION.value:
        # Handle event registration
        pass
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Unsupported task")

def classify_task(wfctx: WorkflowContext, user_message: str) -> str:
    """Classify the task for a workflow run."""
    form_type, _ = classify_form_type(wfctx, user_message)
    if form_type == FormType.INVOICE:
        wfctx.workflow_run.goto_task(task_id=FormType.INVOICE.value)
        return "Could you please tell me more about the invoice?"
    elif form_type == FormType.EVENT_REGISTRATION:
        wfctx.workflow_run.goto_task(task_id=FormType.EVENT_REGISTRATION.value)
        return "Could you please tell me more about event registration?"
    return "Could you please clarify what you need help with?"

def get_workflow_context(workflow_run_id: str) -> WorkflowContext:
    """Get the workflow context for a workflow run."""
    # Load workflow run using provided identifier
    wfrun = _wf.load_run(workflow_run_id)
    if wfrun is None:
        # When a workflow run is not found, inform the client
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Workflow run not found")

    # Instantiate workflow context
    return WorkflowContext.from_workflow(wfrun, [_wfagent])
```

In the `classify_task` function that we've just defined we call a helper method `classify_form_type`
which calls out to the agent and classifies the user's message via structured attributes.
Depending on the result we then update the `NodeState` to a different task through the `wfctx.workflow_run.goto_task` method.
Additionally, we return a message to the user to let them know what to do next.

Say we updated the `NodeState` to `FormType.INVOICE.value`, the next time the user sends a message our chatbot will know to handle the invoice.

There are obvious caveats to our approach, such as what happens if the user's message is not clear, or if the user's message is not
related to the invoice or event registration, or if a user wants to switch tasks.
We won't cover those topics in this example, but we plan on putting out best practices for building chatbots with Fixpoint in the future.

#### Workflow Run > Forms

In this section we'll discuss forms.
We'll start by talking about how to store and retrieve forms that contain information about invoices at any state of a `WorkflowRun`.
We won't focus on how to gather form information from the user, this is covered in the next section.

Forms are attributes of a `WorkflowRun` and are used to store structured information about the forms that the chatbot has gathered from the user.

```python {2,9,14,44,46-48,75-100}
import os
from typing import cast
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from fixpoint_extras.services.formagent.setup import get_workflow_agent
from fixpoint_extras.workflows.imperative import (
    Workflow,
    WorkflowRun,
    WorkflowContext,
    Form,
)
from fixpoint_extras.services.formagent.tasks import (
    classify_form_type,
    FormType,
    InvoiceQuestions,
)

_openai_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
if not _openai_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set or is empty")

_wfagent = get_workflow_agent(
    openai_key=_openai_key,
    model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo",
)

_wf = Workflow(id="test_workflow")

app = FastAPI()


@app.post("/workflow_runs")
def create_workflow_run() -> WorkflowRun:
    """Create a new workflow run."""
    return _wf.run()

@app.post("/workflow_runs/{workflow_run_id}/chats")
def create_chat(workflow_run_id: str, user_message: str) -> str:
    """Create a chat for a workflow run."""
    wfctx = get_workflow_context(workflow_run_id)
    task = wfctx.workflow_run.node_state.task
    if task == "__main__":
        return classify_task(wfctx, user_message)
    elif task == FormType.INVOICE.value:
        return invoice_task(wfctx, user_message)
    elif task == FormType.EVENT_REGISTRATION.value:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400, detail="Event registration task currently not supported"
        )
    else:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Unsupported task")

def classify_task(wfctx: WorkflowContext, user_message: str) -> str:
    """Classify the task for a workflow run."""
    form_type, _ = classify_form_type(wfctx, user_message)
    if form_type == FormType.INVOICE:
        wfctx.workflow_run.goto_task(task_id=FormType.INVOICE.value)
        return "Could you please tell me more about the invoice?"
    elif form_type == FormType.EVENT_REGISTRATION:
        wfctx.workflow_run.goto_task(task_id=FormType.EVENT_REGISTRATION.value)
        return "Could you please tell me more about event registration?"

    return "Could you please clarify what you need help with?"

def get_workflow_context(workflow_run_id: str) -> WorkflowContext:
    """Get the workflow context for a workflow run."""
    # Load workflow run using provided identifier
    wfrun = _wf.load_run(workflow_run_id)
    if wfrun is None:
        # When a workflow run is not found, inform the client
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Workflow run not found")

    # Instantiate workflow context
    return WorkflowContext.from_workflow(wfrun, [_wfagent])

def invoice_task(wfctx: WorkflowContext, user_message: str) -> str:
    """Handle the invoice task for a workflow run."""
    wfrun = wfctx.workflow_run
    form_id = "invoice_questions"
    stored_form = wfrun.forms.get(form_id=form_id)

    if stored_form is None:
        form = Form[InvoiceQuestions](
            id=form_id,
            workflow_run_id=wfrun.id,
            form_schema=InvoiceQuestions,
        )
    else:
        form = cast(Form[InvoiceQuestions], stored_form)

    # Some magic happens here to gather new information about the form and merge it with the existing contents
    contents = '...'

    if stored_form is None:
        wfrun.forms.store(form_id=form_id, schema=InvoiceQuestions)
    wfrun.forms.update(form_id=form_id, contents=contents)

    # Some magic happens here to determine what message to send to the user
    return '...'
```

Here we've added a new method called `invoice_task` which is responsible for gathering information related to invoices as well as
communicating with the user on what to do next with regards to invoices.
The `create_chat` method was also updated to call `invoice_task` when the task is `FormType.INVOICE.value`.
Additionally, we won't handle event registrations in this example, so instead we'll raise an error if the task is `FormType.EVENT_REGISTRATION.value`.

In this snippet we define a new form_id, `invoice_questions`, and use it to store and update the form.
We first check whether a form with the given `form_id` exists. If it does, we use it. If it doesn't, we create a new one. In this particular
example the form is created with the `InvoiceQuestions` schema, which is a Pydantic model that represents the information we want from the user.

After we've loaded form contents we'll need to update the form with new information.
We do this by first calling `wfrun.forms.store` to register the form schema and then calling `wfrun.forms.update` to update the form contents.

This allows our chatbot to retrieve and update the form with new information between requests!

#### InfoGatherer

The `InfoGatherer` class is a tool that is used to gather information from the user.
It is a wrapper around a `Form` object and provides a simple interface to format questions and gather information from the user.
One big benefit of using `InfoGatherer` is that it encapsulates the logic for figuring out what pieces of information
are missing from the form and what questions to ask the user. Behind the scene it uses tool calling to get structured information from the agent.
You can find the full implementation of InfoGatherer [here](https://github.com/gofixpoint/fixpoint/blob/main/src/fixpoint_extras/services/formagent/controllers/infogather.py).

Let's modify our existing example to use `InfoGatherer` to gather information from the user.

    else:

        return more_questions
```

then call a convenience functino `gather_invoice_info` to get the information from an LLM.
If the form is complete we return the form contents, otherwise we return more questions to the user.
