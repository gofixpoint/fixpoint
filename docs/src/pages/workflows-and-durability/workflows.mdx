# Workflows

There are two ways of modeling workflows:

1. **Structured Workflows**: let you decorate your normal Python functions and
   classes so what looks like a normal program gets the abilities of:
   durability, AI memory, human-in-the-loop, and workflow-specific RAG.
2. **Request/Reply Workflows**: a client/server request/response model. This is
   well suited for chatbots where the workflow only advances to the next step
   after a user interaction.
3. **Imperative Workflows**: this is a lower-level API that gives you direct
   control over a workflow's run. You can control the tasks and steps within a
   workflow, and the documents, forms, and memories available to your AI agents.

When using workflows, you first define a `Workflow` and run instances of it by
creating `WorkflowRun` objects. The interface for doing this depends on what
type of workflow you are using, so read on for more details.

## Structured Workflows

Structured workflows let you decorate functions and classes to define workflows
that are [durable][durable], give agents memory about the steps the tasks and
steps in a workflow, load docs for RAG or search, and add human-in-the-loop.

It is also possible to have interruption points within the workflow for human or
external input.

If you are familiar with [Temporal](https://temporal.io/), structured workflows
look similarly, but each workflow is given extra LLM-specific features. The
name is inspired by [structured programming][structured-programming].

See more docs and an example in the
[structured workflows section](/workflows-and-durability/structured-workflows).

## Request/Reply Workflows

Request/Reply Workflows follow a client/server pattern, where each request in
the workflow generates a response. This is well suited for chatbots where the
workflow only advances to the next step after a user interaction.

When building a Request/Reply Workflow, your AI agents have memories about their
past responses and can save and update state, such as documents or structured
data forms. This is useful for making your AI remember the past conversation
details with a user, or for building chatbots that can extract structured data
before deciding to pass that data off to another program or change the
conversation topic.

See more docs and example use cases in the
[Request/Reply Workflows section](/workflows-and-durability/request-reply-workflows).

## Imperative Workflows

The Imperative Workflows API is a lower-level API. Structured Workflows and
Request/Reply Workflows are built on top of it. If one of the higher level APIs
fits better, use that, but we don't discourage you from directly using the
Imperative Workflow API.

The Imperative Workflow API lets you directly control:

- the state of a running workflow
- the tasks and steps within a workflow and transitions between tasks and steps
- the documents available for your AI agents to search over
- the forms available for your AI agents to fill out

Within a workflow run, your AI agents have access to their "memories", aka all
past inference requests within a workflow run.
