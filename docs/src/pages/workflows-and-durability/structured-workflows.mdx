# Structured workflows

Structured workflows let you decorate functions and classes to define workflows
that:

- are [durable][durable] - if the workflow fails partway through, we can resume
  without repeating past steps and duplicating LLM inference requests, saving you
  money
- give agents memory about the steps the tasks steps in a workflow,
- record all LLM and agent interactions for observability
- load docs for RAG or search relevant to the workflow
- add human-in-the-loop, or pause-and-resume points so you can pause a workflow
  while waiting for external input

If you are familiar with [Temporal](https://temporal.io/), structured workflows
look similarly, but each workflow is given extra LLM-specific features.  The
name is inspired by [structured programming][structured-programming].
