# Structured Data and Tool Calling

AI agents become much more useful when they can interact with normal computer
programs. This means they need to be able to reliably output structured data.
Various LLM providers call this "tool calling" or "function calling".

Inference providers such as OpenAI allow tool-calling, and you specify tools as
JSON schemas. You can use tools in this way with Fixpoint, but we also integrate
with [Instructor](https://python.useinstructor.com/), which makes it even easier
to define and use tools. To keep it short, Instructor lets you define tools as
[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) models.

## Use cases for structured outputs

Tool calls and structured outputs have a variety of uses:

- have your LLM produce API calls to other applications
- parse structured data from unstructured inputs
- force the AI to output data in a consisent format, so you don't have flaky
  parsing logic


## An example

Here is an example of an LLM agent that helps you pick a car from one of a few
options.

```python
import json
import os
from typing import Literal, Union
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

import fixpoint
from fixpoint.agents.openai import OpenAIClients

class SportsCar(BaseModel):
    explanation: str = Field(description="An explanation of why you picked the given car")
    car: Union[Literal['Porsche 911'], Literal['Honda Fit'], Literal['Ford F-150']] = Field(
        description="the make and model of the car"
    )

agent = fixpoint.agents.oai.OpenAI(
    model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo',
    openai_clients=OpenAIClients.from_api_key(os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']),
)

compl = agent.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {"role": "user",
         "content": "Can you help me pick out a new sports car? I often need to haul a lot of cargo"},
    ],
    response_model=SportsCar
)

# The simplest way to access the structured output, which is a filled in
# Pydantic model
compl.fixp.structured_output
# The result looks something like this:
# SportsCar(
#   explanation='It is important to have a sports car that can haul cargo efficiently',
#   car='Ford F-150'
# )


# You can also access the plain chat completion response and pull out the tool
# call arguments
tool_call_dict = json.loads(compl.choices[0].message.tool_calls[0].function.arguments)
```
