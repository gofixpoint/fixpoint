# Getting started with Fixpoint

We're working towards supporting every programming language, but for now we only
support Python. You can install Fixpoint with pip:

```bash
pip install fixpoint
```

## A simple example

Let's say you already have an OpenAI app, but you want to give your AI memory
and output structured data via [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor).
You can just swap out your OpenAI client and have a compatible interface.

```python
```

### More examples

See some more of our examples:

- A [Request/Reply Workflow example](/workflows-and-durability/request-reply-workflows#in-depth-use-case-a-chatbot-form-wizard)
  that chats with a user to gather a set of answers and fill out an internal
  form
- A [Structured Workflow example](/workflows-and-durability/structured-workflows#in-depth-use-case-comparing-multiple-llm-models)
  that concurrently compares different LLM models on a prompt, and checkpoints
  all inference requests so you if your experiment fails you don't respend
  on LLM inference when you restart it
