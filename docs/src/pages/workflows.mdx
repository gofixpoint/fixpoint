# Workflows

## Structured workflows

Structured workflows let you write your workflows as normal, procedural-style
code. You can decorate certain functions as being for a task or a step within
the workflow, which lets Fixpoint's infra remember what your workflow has done
so far.

## Request/response workflows

Request/response workflows are ideal for things like chatbots or other
situations where every single step in the workflow comes from a user
interaction.
