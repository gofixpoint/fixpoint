# Library Mode

With Library Mode, the goal is that you can take an existing LLM application
and mix in extra capabilities.

That means adding memory, caching, agent callbacks, etcetera without having to
set up any new infrastructure. There are some things you'll miss out on in this
mode, such as data and workflow durability in the face of system failure, but
it's a great way to get started and add some extra capabilities to your
programs.

See the docs on [setting up agents](/agents), adding [memory](/memory) and
[caching](/workflows-and-durability/caching). For any of these, if you use
in-memory or on-disk storage, you can effectively just drop in these
capabilities and not change any other parts of your system.
