# Workflows and Durability

Fixpoint helps make your LLM workflows "durable". By that, we mean they are
reliable in the face of system failure or inference provider timeouts.
[Temporal](https://temporal.io/) coined the term "durable execution", and we
layer on top of that the powers that LLMs need to run in a reliable workflow.

This helps you in a few ways:

1. In production, if part of your workflow fails, you can pick up where you left off
2. During development, if you are iterating on your code in a notebook or a test
   script, you can save prior LLM inference requests so you don't waste money on
   token spend
3. In your CI environment, when you want to test code that uses an LLM inference
   provider, but don't actually want to spend money on inference calls
