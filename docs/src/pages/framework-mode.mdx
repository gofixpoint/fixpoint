# Framework Mode

If you are building multi-step workflows that coordinate one or more AIs, you'll
want to start using Fixpoint's workflows so your code is:

- reliable in the face of system failure
- easier to trace and understand multiple steps
- easy to extend workflows with extra steps, or run more complex AI inference
  requests in parallel
- can layer in human-in-the-loop wherever necessary

Refer to the [workflows docs](/workflows-and-durability/workflows) for info on
how to use workflows, or check out a worflow example in the
[Getting Started section](/getting-started).
