# Modes Overview

A design principle at Fixpoint is that our library and infra should meet
developers where they are, and compose with their own code as simply as
possible. If you just want the basics, you can drop them in anywhere in your
program. If you want more advanced features, you can progressively adopt them.

We say that Fixpoint runs in 3 modes:

1. [**Library mode**][library-mode]: pick and choose the components components
   you want to add to your existing AI application. Add memory, caching,
   checkpointing, without changing any part of your code.
2. [**Framework mode**][framework-mode]: Build multi- or single-agent workflows with
   Fixpoint, and use your existing document stores and databases.
3. [**Infra mode**][infra-mode]: Use Fixpoint's platform for agent workflows so
   you don't need to operate your own durable workflow infra or set up databases
   for AI memory and documents.
