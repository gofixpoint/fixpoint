# Frequently Asked Questions

Have a question? Join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/tdRmQQXAhY) or email us
at help@fixpoint.co. We'll put common questions in here.

## Where is the code?

You can find the code on Github: https://github.com/gofixpoint/fixpoint/

Fixpoint is fully open-source, so what you see is what we run!


## How can I get access to the Fixpoint platform?

If you don't want to run Fixpoint's infra yourself, you can use our hosted
platform. We'll take care of all of the devops infra for you, so you can just
focus on writing your LLM workflows and applications.

The hosted platform is in development, so
