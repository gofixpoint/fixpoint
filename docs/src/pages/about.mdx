## What is Fixpoint's vision?

We believe the future of AI is multi-model, with specialized models coordinating
together to accomplish their goals.

The next big AI unlock will be AIs that can reason, with automated planning,
prioritization, and self-checking of agent quality. But for now, the best LLM
systems compose LLM usage with "intelligently designed" traditional computer
programs.

We want to meet AI engineers where they are now, and let them build hand-crafted
agent networks that they control. But we also keep an eye towards the future, to
create AI agent networks that can reason. The dream end goal: you have a
Manager AI that picks the best agents, does task planning, and coordinates how
the agents work together.

## Who are we?

We're [Dylan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbmikus/) and [Jakub](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jakub-cichon-14016a3b/)!

We've built machine learning and data infrastructure systems for businesses
ranging from small startups to public tech companies. We built and led the
search infrastructure and real-time data pipelines at Oscar Health, studied and
researched natural language processing and CS at CMU and NYU, and founded a
Y-Combinator company together.

As engineers, we're fans of open-source software because we think it's important
that you control the core infra of your products, and that you always have the
option to run it yourselves.
