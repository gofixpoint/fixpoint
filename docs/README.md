# Fixpoint docs

The docs for Fixpoint's open source infra for reliable multi-step AI workflows.

Build and connect multiple AI agents that know your data and work together to
run autonomous or human-in-the-loop workflows, so that the humans can focus on
more important work.

The Fixpoint docs are built with [Nextra](https://nextra.site).
